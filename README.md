# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub
I am a follower and lover of Jesus Christ -- He is absolutely the greatest!
I am a retired pastor and still speak and teach the Bible occasionally upon
invitation.
I am happily married to Edith, my best friend and companion on earth. We have
two children, 4 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren.
I am also a software engineer for a large corporation specializing primarily
in web application development primarily in ASP.NET as well as Javascript.
I enjoy target shooting, hunting, fishing and outdoor activities generally.
